# Music-Equations
Generating music from math equations

Works by asking a user for an equation and plugging in values from 1-n for values of that equation. It then takes the mod of x where x is the amount of notes in the sequence. This way, it can map any number into a note index which is then used to find out which frequency corresponds to the note. There are several features in the program such as octaves, tempo, iterations, and chords.
